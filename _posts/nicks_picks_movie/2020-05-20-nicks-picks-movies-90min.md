A coworker recently sent me a quote by Mark Twain that goes something like,

> “If you want me to give you a two-hour presentation, I am ready today. If you want only a five-minute speech, it will take me two weeks to prepare.”

Being concise is difficult. When someone asks you about something you don't really know, your answer tends to be way longer than if you had known. It's easier that way-- we can try to reach the point from several different directions, adding in metaphors and tangents to our heart's content. We hope that the more we talk, the more our audience loses their path and eventually accepts that we actually know what we're talking about.

Filmmakers tend to do this as well. When they don't really understand the kernel of the movie they're trying to make, they add establishing shots, moody transition scenes, and montages to mask a lack of substance. What you end up with is a bloated, meandering film that probably gets praised for being "challenging" and "a slow burn".

Well today, I wanted to celebrate the movies that clock in under 90 minutes. Enough rambling, let's get to it:

#### 1. The Squid and the Whale (2005)

This is my favorite semi-autobiographical Noah Baumbach movie about two pretentious New Yorkers that go through a painful divorce. In fact, I think *Squid and the Whale* succeeds in many of the ways *Marriage Story* falters. Mostly due to the amazing ensemble (led by Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney as the aforementioned divorcees), and partly due to an oddball, daring script, *Squid and the Whale* expertly shifts between humor and grief in pretty much every scene. And yet it's always grounded. Filmed on location in Park Slope, Brooklyn in an apartment owned by Baumbach's real life childhood friend, *Squid and the Whale* captures an incredible sense of place. Hell, Jeff Daniels even wears Baumbach's Father's actual clothes.

__Runtime:__ 88 minutes

__Fun fact:__ The British sad-boy band _Noah and the Whale_ is named after Noah Baumbach and, well, yeah you get it.

#### 2. Before Sunset (2004)

While Richard Linklater's _Boyhood_ would definitely fall under the "challenging", "slow burn" category, his second entry in the _Before_ trilogy is a masterclass in brevity. The movie picks up Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy nine years after they last saw each other. Having forged their own paths and now in the dog days of adulthood, they come to realize that the passionate affection they felt for each other all those years ago has evolved into mature, durable love. Shot in real-time with long tracking shots, and making other mumblecore entries look like a silent film, _Before Sunset_ reminds us that sometimes the best moments with our loved ones are just walking around and talking.

__Runtime:__ 80 minutes

__Fun fact:__ The longest single take in the movie is 11 minutes

#### 3. What We Do in the Shadows (2014)

I've watched two sketch-based mockumentaries with the same group of friends: _Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping_, and this. Whereas _Popstar_ is more frequently laugh-out-loud hilarious, _Shadows_ is the more clever, and ultimately better, film. The movie is based on a simple premise: what if extremely average Kiwis also happened to be vampires. We see the four main vampires (and roommates) struggle to get ready for a night out because they can't see their reflections in the mirror. Or asking the bouncers to invite them inside as that's the only way they can enter. But the best moments have Jemaine Clement's (_Flight of the Concords_) and Taika Waititi's (_Jojo Rabbit_) characters getting into petty, mundane arguments that seem all too, well, human.

__Runtime__: 85 minutes

__Fun fact:__ Clement and Waititi met in undergrad at Victoria University of Wellington and have been collaborating ever since

#### 4. Borat (2006)

I was thirteen when _Borat_ came out, which tells you a lot about the subsequent fourteen years. I couldn't believe they had actually let this movie be made. It completely changed my idea of what a film could do: vulgar beyond belief and yet consistently touching and heartfelt, ridiculously silly with a clever eye on the grotesque underbelly of the US. You come for Sasha Baron Cohen getting in a ten minute naked wrestling scene with his obese manager, and you stay for the searing indictment of frat culture and racism in the American South.

__Runtime:__ 84 minutes

__Fun fact:__ The [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borat) for _Borat_ is a work of art in and of itself, but my favorite fact is that Baron Cohen is actually speaking Hebrew throughout the film, not Kazakh, and his manager is speaking Armenian. There is no Kazakh spoken in the entire movie.

#### 5. Toy Story (1995)

People often argue which Toy Story is the best, but one thing you can't argue is that the first one is objectively the shortest. Kicking off the Pixar dynasty, _Toy Story_ ushered in a post-Disney era in filmmaking for children (ya know, until Disney acquired them). Whereas Disney focused on appealing solely to children, _Toy Story_ foreshadowed Pixar's ability to balance guileless fun with clever references for adults. Featuring a fantastic voice cast and fantastic animation (for its time), _Toy Story_ is the nostalgic milkshake of a movie you probably need during quarantine.

__Runtime:__ 81 minutes

__Fun fact:__ Production of the movie was completely shut down by Disney, who was financing the movie, and who was not pleased by the reels coming from Pixar. Steve Jobs, then CEO of Pixar, funded the project personally during the shutdown as both parties waited for a new script.
